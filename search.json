    "text": "Introduction\nThis handbook was developed with the aim of providing a consolidated guidance document covering the key aspects of Information Management (IM) for Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM). It was created to fill the gaps in guidance specific to information management in CCCM and to document, consolidate and streamline existing IM practices within the sector.1\nThe primary audience for this handbook are information management staff of all levels, who are involved, or plan to be involved in IM for CCCM in either a programmes or cluster capacity. The handbook is also relevant to non IM personnel especially coordinators, acknowledging the importance of understanding both data literacy and CCCM analytical norms outside of the IM function.\nThe handbook is presented in three parts, broadly reflecting the differing use-cases and audiences.\nThe handbook is available as a website (viewable on desktop or phone) or can be download as a pdf or kindle format for offline viewing. While viewing the web version, the left margin shows the three parts of the handbook, containing each chapter. Some of the larger chapters are split into sections (denoted by a downward-facing arrow). The right margin of the screen are for easy navigation through the content ofe ach chapter/section.\nHumanitarian approaches and tools grow and change over time, which is particularly evident in the field of information management. This handbook aims to be a living document whose contents will be continually updated to reflect our growing knowledge and best practices, and evolution in our approaches and tools in both IM and CCCM."

    "text": "1.1 What is data?\nData is the physical representation of information in a manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human beings or by automatic means.2 It can be structured or unstructured, can come in many different forms (human-readable or machine-readable) and can come from any number of sources, using any number of methods. While the terms data, information and knowledge are quite often used interchangeably it is helpful to think of information as data integrated into context, and knowledge as a collection of information, processed in a way that provides learning."

    "text": "1.2 What does it look like?\nData is all around us but is usually messy and unstructured. Processing this information into a structure that can provide sense is at the core of IM. This ‘sense-making’ can use different approaches - an experienced camp manager may decide to walk into a new camp, walk around it observing it, deciding on what actions they need to prioritize. Another may prefer to set up a list of indicators to measure specific needs in the camp. The approaches are different (and quite often complimentary) but the goal and process are to a large extent the same.\n:::{admonition} Exercise Take a look at your desk and choose an object. Describe the attributes of that item. Perhaps you can describe the items colour, its length, its width, its texture, the materials its constructed from or how effective it is for your work. A surprising amount of data can be gathered from even the simplest of objects. :::\nTo get from messy data to structured that that can be used - by itself, or more commonly in conjunction with other datasets - a degree of organizing, tagging or categorizing must take place. If a survey is used, those categories are determined by the questions asked the type of questions and the response options. When setting these categories it is very important that each person involved with the data - from the person giving the response, the enumerator right up to those whose programmatic decisions it informs - has a clear and common understanding of what and how a concept is captured in these categories.\n\n1.2.1 Formats\nValuable humanitarian data can often start out as paper survey responses, hand written notes (ie. distribution details) or as handwritten notes (such as from Focus Group Discussions). To aid the cleaning, processing and management of this data, digitization may be required. Digital data can be stored in a number of the following formats and is closely linked to the tools used to gather and/or store the data:\n\nTabular data: By far the most common format for humanitarian data, Excel or Comma Separated Value (CSV) files show data as a table where each column represent as variable in your data and each row ideally represents an observation. 3\nRelational databases: Data cant always be represented in a single table. Quite often there is a need to present the data across multiple tables, showing the linkages(relationships) between variables in different table. Relational databases provide an underlying data model for most modern websites and software. An example use for a relational database could be in the recording of trainings, where one table contains rows, each representing a single training while a second table contains the list of participants. The relationships between these two tables could be defined as each training can contain multiple participants and each participant can attend multiple trainings\nAPIs To aid the access and transfer of data, it is very common for modern software systems to have an API, in which other websites (or data analysis tools) can request data from the underlying data store. The most common file format for these is called JSON, a semi-human readable format with the advantage over tabular formats in that is can represent messy semi-structured data or complex relationships that would otherwise require a database. 4\nSpatial: Spatial data formats such as .shp, .gpg, .geojson .geotiff or .dem are used to store 2d or 3d spatial data. Most of these formats can display or export to tabular formats.\n\n\n\n\nExamples of data as tables, a relational database, and as JSON from an travel distance API\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Sources\n\nCommon Operating Datasets (CODs)\nHDX\nInternal systems\nOthers\nNon traditional sources"

    "text": "1.3 Data concepts\n\n1.3.1 Values\nSimple data values can be numeric; such as an integer (whole number) or float; boolean, such as a yes/no or true/false; or a string, a sequence of symbols such as a text answer. Compound values are combinations of simple values. Examples include dates, time, or list of values (such as a list of answers to a multiple choice question) 5\n\n\n1.3.2 Types of data\nVariables (items of data) can spilt into two groups, quantitative (numeric) or categoric (no inherent order). Quantitative variables can either be discrete, meaning they have a finite number of values (eg household size) or continuous, meaning an infinite number of values are possible (eg. a persons height or distance to a health facility)\n\n\n1.3.3 Scales\nData can be classified under the following 4 scales of measurement:\n\nNominal scales: Nominal values/variables, sometimes called categorical values don’t have a numeric value so cannot be added, subtracted or multiplied. They do not have an order. For example, the name of a district that an IDP is from.\nOrdinal scale: Contains values that can be put in order. For example, the levels of satisfaction with a training.\nInterval scale: Contains ordinal numbers with meaningful divisions. For example, temperature or time.\nRatio scale: Ratio scales have all of the characteristics of interval scales as well as a true zero. For example, a persons height.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of data and how they relate\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Goal/Strategic Objective\nA specific end result desired or expected to occur as a consequence, at least in part, of an intervention or activity. It is the higher order objective that will assure national capacity building to which a development intervention is intended to contribute.\n\n\n1.3.5 Impact\nImpact implies changes in people’s lives. This might include changes in knowledge, skill, behaviour, health or living conditions for children, adults, families or communities. Such changes are positive or negative longterm effects on identifiable population groups produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended.\n\n\n1.3.6 Outcome\nOutcomes represent changes in the institutional and behavioral capacities for development conditions that occur between the completion of outputs and the achievement of goals.\n\n\n1.3.7 Outputs\nOutputs are changes in skills or abilities and capacities of individuals or institutions, or the availability of new products and services that result from the completion of activities within a development intervention within the control of the organization. They are achieved with the resources provided and within the time period specified.\n\n\n1.3.8 Activities\nActions taken or work performed through which inputs, such as funds, technical assistance and other types of resources, are mobilized to produce specific outputs.\n\n\n1.3.9 Inputs\nThe financial, human, material, technological and information resources used for development interventions.\n\n\n1.3.10 Indicators\nUsually separated into two categories: - Need indicators: a quantitative or qualitative unit of measurement of need which when monitored periodically can be used as a measure of impact. - Response/performance indicators: used to measure outputs or outcomes.\n\n\n1.3.11 Target\nSpecifies a particular value that an indicator should reach by to meet agreed standard of service or programme goals. Setting target values for most indicators requires a level of contextualization and can be influences by external factors such as resources available.\n\n\n1.3.12 Standard\n…\n\n\n1.3.13 Benchmark\nReference point or standard, including norms, against which progress or achievements can be assessed. A benchmark refers to the performance that has been achieved in the recent past by other comparable organizations, or what can be reasonably expected to have been achieved in similar circumstances.\n\n\n1.3.14 Primary data vs secondary data\n…"

    "section": "1.4 Information Management tips",
    "text": "1.4 Information Management tips\nThe following tips are a collection of commonly encountered issues in humanitarian IM and how to avoid them. The tips are a shortened from their usual form to avoid overlap with other chapters where many of the issues are expanded in more detail.6\n\n1.4.1 Use Excel for numerical data\n\n\n\nTatsuo Horiuchi uses Excel to paint beautiful Japanese lanscapes. Don’t follow Tatsuo\n\n\nDon’t use software such as Word for gathering and analysing numerical data. Likewise, be careful not to use Excel to over visualise how your data is represented. Simple, well structured data is best for analysis and sharing with others.\n\n\n1.4.2 Save often, use versioning, and name files sensibly\n\n\n\nClick save!\n\n\nYou don’t want to work all day on an analysis to suddenly find that the fil crashed before you had a chance to save it. In Excel, there is an option to have your files autosave at a specified interval.\nIf saving to OneDrive or Sharepoint, you will see a small downward arrow which allows youto view the file’s Version History. to view or roll back to previous version of a document. Alternatively you can save multiple versions of the file following certain milestones or use a software versioning software such as Git.\nTry have you and your team use a consistent, welll understood naming convention for files. The format I use is as follows: [year][month(2digists)][date]-[initials]-[version]. For example 20182307-IMtips-BMD-v1.xlsx File > Options to get Excel to save more regularly\n\n\n1.4.3 Backup your data\nWhat if your computer crashes or is stolen?\nWhat if you need to collaborate on a file?\nMake use of Onedrive/Sharepoint. Onedrive is ideal for working documents (you can right-click on a file and share it collaboratively).\n\n\n1.4.4 Check for existing data, communicate\nNetworking and communication are important but sometimes overlooked skills for IM. It’s important to know what other agencies and clusters are planning in terms of data collection and what challenges they are facing that may be better addressed with a collective approach. Checking for pre-existing data or planning assessments can help avoid duplication of efforts and unnecessarily reinventing the wheel.\n\n\n1.4.5 Use mobile data collection\nThe use of mobile data collection tools such as Kobo Toolbox support faster and more robust data collection. By enforcing checks on data inputs it reduces input errors, while also removing time consuming and error-prone tasks of manual data entry of paper forms.\nWhile ideal for surveys/assessments, be careful not to over-fit such tools into scenarios that require case management type functionality.\n\n\n1.4.6 Consistent variable naming\nAre we talking about the same thing? The terms/concepts describe in your surveys and data - does everyone have a clear and shared understanding of what they mean? Are you reusing well known and tested terms or are you inventing new ones. 7\n\n\n1.4.7 Understand meta-data\n\n…and why it is important. Meta-data is data that described data. For example, your survey data files should contain information describing where the data was collected, on which dates, the methodology used and relevant focal point. Including metadata in your datasets is an important habit for IMs, as it encourages reuse of the data and signifies a robust approach to analysis.\n\n\n1.4.8 Spreadsheets - only one piece of information per cell\n\nStoring multiple points of data in a single cell makes many types of analysis very difficult. Where possible try to expand these values onto their own rows (sometimes called “exploding” or “melting”.)\n\n\n1.4.9 Record data at a granular level and aggregate up\nWhen you have data at a low unit of measurement, for example, the number of people using a specific Complaints and Feedback (CFM) desk, it is straightforward to aggregate that data to a higher unit, for example, the number of people using CFMs in a district. However, be careful of receiving data already aggregated as it is usually not possible to disaggregate it into its component parts. If your analysis depends on having data at a certain unit-level, make sure to have it collected or sent to you in at least the same or lower level of disaggregation. Aggregation may hide or disregard useful data useful for your analysis or quality control.\n\n\n1.4.10 Learn pivot tables\n Pivot tables are a powerful tool for aggregating data in Excel. (also called “groupby” in other software)\n\n\n1.4.11 Learn VLOOKUP and Index Match\n\n\n\nvlookup\n\n\n\n\n1.4.12 Don’t merge cells in a spreadsheet\n\nDon’t merge cells in a spreadsheet. Tables should contain an equal number of rows and columns. Merging cells breaks pivoting and filtering and goes against rule number 1 (when done for reasons of aesthetics).\n\n\n1.4.13 Keep data types and names consistent in columns\n\nMake sure that the spelling (including case) and format of values remain consistent for all values in a column.\n\n\n1.4.14 Keep all similar data in one sheet\n\nResist the temptation to split large datasets across tabs, using a tab for each region etc. This makes analysis and consolidated storage and management of the data harder. Instead add a column to capture the category names.\n\n\n1.4.15 Check data relationships\n\n\n\ncheck relationaships\n\n\n\n\n1.4.16 Get coordinates for point data\n\nIf you have data that represents a point such as a hospital or a camp, instead of just naming it or giving its address you could also collect coordinates for it. There are many possible ways of doing this:\n\nUsing any app on your phone that records GPS\nIn a mobile data collection tool such as Kobo Toolbox\nUsing a geocoder, which outputs coordinates for given addresses or locations. Nominatim is a free service using Open Street Map data.\nThe low tech approach of drawing on paper maps, digitizing later. Fieldpapers"

Good analysis requires us to first start with an articulation of what are the overarching questions that need answering and what decisions will be informed by this evidence.\nThe next step is to take stock of existing data and to develop an analysis plan linking your information needs to you existing data and/or any potential future data collection exercises.\nCollection of data has costs - it costs time, it has HR costs, it has financial costs. It is important to understand these costs and viewing them in relation to the value it provides to your decision making. Similarly, when developing surveys, adding questions are no without cost, as for each question that is added, there is a cognitive cost(more questions = higher likelihood of mistakes), a time cost (longer surveys take longer to do) and a quality cost (cleaning and data checks are more difficult on larger datasets). Understand that 80% of the value of your survey will come from 20% of your survey. As you add additional questions to your survey, the value they add to your decision-making diminishes. 1\n\n\n\nAs your number of survey questions increase, the return on effort gradually diminishes."

    "section": "5.1 How to write about numbers",
    "text": "5.1 How to write about numbers\nWhen preparing to write up an analysis, it is important to first consider the following:\nDetermine your objectives. Is the intention to inform or update a group on recent activities? Is it to provide insight on a particular topic? Is it to change peoples understanding or decisions on an particular operational issue? Is it to engage with people to gather feedback or to take action?\nIdentify your target audience. What group or groups are you targeting with the above objectives? You will need to tailor the language(non technical experts may not be familiar with technical language), length (shorter messages may be more suitable for general public consumption) and style (different audiences have different lenses in which they will consume and interpret your message).\nThere are seven basic principles about writing about numbers: 2\n\nEstablish the context for your facts. Your text should convey the “who, what, when and where” in which to ground your facts. Don’t just assume that the audience has the same contextual understanding.\nPick simple, plausible examples. Using examples are a good way to transform abstract numbers to more tangible and relatable to the audiences experiences or understanding. An example of this could be used when describing density of the population of Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, where comparing the population number and area of the camp can be compared to that of a comparison city familiar to the audience.\nSelect the right tools and media for the job. The three basic tools for presenting quantitative information: prose, tables and charts. Choosing the most appropriate tool (or mix of them) and understanding their strengths and weaknesses, is important. Equally important is to use the most appropriate mix of media. Eg. Reports, interactive dashboards, infographics, video, social media, events.\nDefining your terms (and be careful with jargon). Unnecessary use of of acronyms and jargon will likely exclude parts of your audience or cause misunderstanding due to unshared understanding of concepts. If acronyms must be used, it is good practice to show them alongside their long form at the point where they first appear.\nReporting and interpreting. Describing the numbers around an issue should be support by an explanation of “what does that mean” that explains why that number is important or relevant.\nSpecify magnitude and direction of an association. Don’t just say “there are more displaced people in camp A than in camp B”, provide a number quantifying how different it is. When explaining the relationship between variables it is also important to be clear on the direction of that relationship. For example “IDPs in Camp A had a lower number of food complaints compared to the previous month”.\nSummarize patterns. Rather than presenting a big table or graph showing the data and letting the viewer figure things out for themselves it is good to summarize and highlight patterns that contribute to the analysis and message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nTell a story\nChoose hooks for your audience\nSay it visually\nBe transparent with the limitations of your analysis"

    "section": "5.2 Data Visualization",
    "text": "5.2 Data Visualization\nCommunicating with visuals can an effective way to communicate a message, either on its own or alongside accompanying text. Good visuals can help engaging the audience and quite often are a good way to convey complex information in a simpler form.\n\n5.2.1 Choosing the right charts\nWhen visualising your data, the choice of chart depends on the quantity and type of data you want to represent; the relationships in that data, and ultimately, whether or not the graph clearly communicates your message.3\nThe following is pseudo-decision tree, to support choosing the most appropriate chart type depending on your data and it relationships.\n\n5.2.1.1 Deviation\nEmphasize variations (+/-) from a fixed reference point. Typically the reference point is zero but it can also be a target or a long-term average. Can also be used to show sentiment (positive/neutral/negative).\nExamples: Showing the number of people entering or exiting a site over a period of time. Showing satisfaction with a component in a training. Demographics pyramid in a site, showing population breakdown by age and gender.\n\nDiverging bar: A simple standard bar chart that can handle both negative and positive magnitude values.\n\nDiverging bar: Perfect for presenting survey results which involve sentiment (eg disagree/neutral/agree).\n\nSpine: Splits a single value into two contrasting components (eg male/female).\n\nSurplus/deficit filled line: The shaded area of these charts allows a balance to be shown – either against a baseline or between two series.\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Correlation\nShow the relationship between two or more variables. Be mindful that, unless you tell them otherwise, many readers will assume the relationships you show them to be causal (i.e. one causes the other).\nExamples: Showing the relationships between areas of origin and current location of displacement.\n\nScatterplot: The standard way to show the relationship between two continuous variables, each of which has its own axis.\n\nColumn + line timeline: A good way of showing the relationship between an amount (columns) and a rate (line).\n\nConnected scatterplot: Usually used to show how the relationship between 2 variables has changed over time.\n\nBubble: Like a scatterplot, but adds additional detail by sizing the circles according to a third variable.\n\nXY heatmap: A good way of showing the patterns between 2 categories of data, less effective at showing fine differences in amounts.\n\n\n5.2.1.3 Ranking\nUse where an item’s position in an ordered list is more important than its absolute or relative value. Don’t be afraid to highlight the points of interest.\nExamples: Comparing indicators of need. Comparing displacement population figures across sites or districts.\n\nHistogram: Standard bar charts display the ranks of values much more easily when sorted into order..\n\nOrdered column: Same as above but more suited to categories of dates or with short labels.\n\nOrdered proportional symbol: Use when there are big variations between values and/or seeing tne differences between data is not so important..\n\nSlope: Perfect for showing how ranks have changed over time or vary betweencategories.\n\nLollipop: Lollipops draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank and value ef effectively.\n\nBump: Effective for showing changing rankings across multiple dates. For large datasets,consider grouping lines using colour.\n\n\n5.2.1.4 Distribution\nShow values in a dataset and how often they occur. The shape (or ‘skew’) of a distribution can be a memorable way of highlighting the lack of uniformity or equality in the data.\nExamples:\n\nHistogram: The standard way to show a statistical distribution - keep the gaps between columns small to highlight the ‘shape’ of the data.\n\nDot plot: A simple way of showing the change or range (min/max) of data across multiple categories.\n\nBox plot: Summarise multiple distributions by showing the median (centre) and range of the data.\n\nPopulation pyramid: A standard way for showing the age and sex breakdown of a population distribution; effectively, back to back histograms.\n\nBeeswarm: Use to emphasise individual points in a distribution. Points can be sized to an additional variable. Best with medium sized datasets.\n\n\n5.2.1.5 Change over time\nGive emphasis to changing trends. These can be short (intra-day) movements or extended series traversing decades or centuries: Choosing the correct time period is important to provide suitable context for the reader.\nExamples:\n\nLine: The standard way to show a changing time series. If data are irregular, consider markers to represent data points.\n\nColumn: Columns work well for showing change over time - but usually best with only one series of data at a time.\n\nColumn and timeline: A good way of showing the relationship over time between an amount (columns) and a rate (line).\n\nSlope: Good for showing changing data as long as the data can be simplifed into 2 or 3 points without missing a key part of story.\n\nArea chart: Use with care – these are good at showingchanges to total, but seeing change in components can be very difficult.\n\nFan chart (projections): Use to show the uncertainty in future projections - usually this grows the further forward to projection.\n\nConnected scatterplot: A good way of showing changing data for two variables whenever there is a relatively clear pattern of progression.\n\nCalendar heatmap: A great way of showing temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly) – at the expense of showing precision in quantity.\n\nPriestley timeline: Great when date and duration are key elements of the story in the data.\n\nCircle timeline: Good for showing discrete values of varying size across multiple categories (eg earthquakes by continent).\n\nStreamgraph: A type of area chart; use when seeing changes in proportions over time is more important than individual values.\n\n\n5.2.1.6 Magnitude\nShow size comparisons. These can be relative (just being able to see larger/bigger) or absolute (need to see fine differences). Usually these show a ‘counted’ number (for example, barrels, dollars or people) rather than a calculated rate or per cent.\nExamples:\n\nStreamgraph: A type of area chart; use when seeing changes in proportions over time is more important than individual values.\n\nBar: See above. Good when the data are not time series and labels have long category names.\n\nPaired column: As per standard column but allows for multiple series. Can become tricky to read with more than 2 series.\n\nMarimekko: A good way of showing the size and proportion of data at the same time – as long as the data are not too complicated.\n\nIsotype (pictogram): Excellent solution in some instances – use only with whole numbers (do not slice of an arm to represent a decimal).\n\nRadar:A space-efficient way of showing value of multiple variables– but make sure they are organised in a way that makes sense to reader.\n\nParallel coordinates: A type of area chart; use when seeing changes in proportions over time is more important than individual values.\n\nGrouped symbol: An alternative to bar/column charts when being able to count data or highlight individual elements is useful.\n\n\n5.2.1.7 Part-to-whole\nShow how a single entity can be broken down into its component elements. If the reader’s interest is solely in the size of the components, consider a magnitude-type chart instead.\nExamples:\n\nStacked column or bar: A simple way of showing part-to-whole relationships but can be difficult to read with more than a few components.\n\nRadar:Similar to a pie chart – but the centre can be a good way of making space to include more information bout the data (eg total).\n\nTreemap:Use for hierarchical part-to-whole relationships; can be difficult to read when there are many small segments.\n\nGridplot:Good for showing % information, they work best when used on whole numbers and work well in small multiple layout form.\n\nVenn:Generally only used for schematic representation.\n\nWaterfall:Can be useful for showing part-to-whole relationships where some of the components are negative.\n\n\n5.2.1.8 Spatial\nAside from locator maps only used when precise locations or geographical patterns in data are more important to the reader than anything else.\nExamples:\n\nBasic choropleth:The standard approach for putting data on a map – should always be rates rather than totals and use a sensible base geography.\n\nProportional symbol: Use for totals rather than rates – be wary that small differences in data will be hard to see.\n\nFlowmap:For showing unambiguous movement across a map.\n\nContour map: For showing areas of equal value on a map. Can use deviation colour schemes for showing +/- values\n\nDot density: Used to show the location of individual events/locations – make sure to annotate any patterns the reader should see.\n\nHeatmap:Can be useful for showing part-to-whole relationships where some of the components are negative.\n\n\n5.2.1.9 Flow\nShow the reader volumes or intensity of movement between two or more states or conditions. These might be logical sequences or geographical locations.\nExamples:\n\nSankey:Can be useful for showing part-to-whole relationships where some of the components are negative.\n\nWaterfall:Can be useful for showing part-to-whole relationships where some of the components are negative.\n\nNetwork:Can be useful for showing part-to-whole relationships where some of the components are negative.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Visual Design Principles\nDeveloped by German psychologists, the Gestalt laws describe how we interpret the complex world around us. They explain why a series of flashing lights appear to be moving. And why we read a sentence like this, notli ket his ort hat. Understanding these “laws” can be useful in making sure your message is being conveyed effectively.\n\n5.2.2.1 Law of Similarity\n\nThe human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated. Examples of this could be the use of symbols to signify conflict on a map or the use of colour in dots in a scatter plot that are of the same category.\n\n\n5.2.2.2 Law of Prägnanz\n\nPeople will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us. Charts should aim to be as complex as necessary and as simple as possible to convey their meaning. Edward Tufte calls this the data-ink ratio.\n\n\n5.2.2.3 Law of Proximity\n\nObjects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.\nAn example of this could be a grouped bar chart where for the funding for each year is grouped by donor.\n\n\n5.2.2.4 Law of Continuity\n\nElements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection. This principle is visible when using a line graph to connect point values.\n\n\n5.2.2.5 Law of Common Region\n\nElements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary. This law is perhaps most commonly used in maps, where administrative boundaries are shown with solid or dashed lines.\nWhen presenting static charts a useful tip is to use annotation to guide the viewer through the graph, to put the data in context and to highlight the key relevant facts. 4\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Use of Colour\nWhen choosing colours in your charts its important to understand possible local significance that may be associated to a specific colour. For instance, in one country a colour may signify good luck, whereas in a different country, the same colour could be associated with a non-state armed group.5\nWhere possible, special attention should be taken to ensure that chart remain readable when printed in gray scale and that they are colour blind safe, meaning that the chart should not be confusing for people with red-green colour blindness (an estimated 8% of men and 0.4% of women).\nAdding to the previous description of the role of color in perception, the use of colour in scales, particularly maps, typically takes one of the following three forms.6\n\n Continuous(sequential) scales used to show values going from low to high. Eg. population density per district.\n Diverging scales which visualize difference from a norm, such as this example showing location in St Vincent that showed both net inward and outward movements of people following the eruption of a volcano.\nCategorical(qualitative) scales used to distinguish different (non numeric) objects eg. a map using different shades for different countries.\n\nTwo of the most common ways to respresent colour are RGB and CMYK. RGB, commonly used on websites can be shown as a hex number or RGB number. For printed materials where colour accuracy is important, CYMK is typically used. Not all software supports the CMYK colour space, so if color accuracy is important you may want to use an Adobe tool such as Illustrator or In Design to apply finishing touches to print materials.7"

    "text": "5.3 Presenting\nHaving a great data collection system, doing great analysis and creating effective visuals don’t necessarily lead to informing or changing decision by themselves. An important skill for IMOs that is often overlooked is the importance of verbal communication and presentation skills, be in in an in-person context such as a Cluster meeting or as is becoming more common, web-based calls. These meeting offer an important window of opportunity where, if communicated clearly and in a convincing manner a good analysis can meet it’s objectives.\nThe following video is an example of effective communication, where the speaker shows a clear understanding of his audience(s), succinctly describes the context, the cause, the call for action (giving specific examples) and the urgency and scale. \nWhen presenting slides, consider the following:\n\nOnly one idea per slide Having multiple ideas presented will distract your audience and confuse your key message.\nExplain your point, then show slide. Your audience can interpret either the visuals on screen or your spoken message. It is very difficult to both at the same time.\nSpeaker is the star, not the slides. The slides exist to aide the communication of the speaker, not to distract from it.\nNever read from the slides. It portrays a lack of preparedness and dilutes the communication rather than complimenting it.\nKeep your hands free to move. Not verbal expression can help the audience relate to the message and can help emphasise key messages.\nTell a story to drive home your message Conveying your message through a narrative is a powerful way to introduce your audience with your key points, for them to engage with the topic and to remember it.\nUse photos and drawings on slides. Photos can help bring an emotive human element into otherwise abstract messages. Effective visuals can communicate concepts that would be much harder to explain through written or spoken word alone.\nFace your audience, not your slides. You are trying to convince, your audience, not the slides.\nAvoid complexity. Unnecessary complexity is a barrier for comprehension and can cause your audience to disengage with the topic.\nRehearse, rehearse, rehearse."
