### Choosing the right charts
When visualising your data, the choice of chart depends on the quantity and type of data you want to respresent; the relationships in that data, and ultimately, whether or not the graph clearly communicates your message.

The following is pseudo-decision tree, to support choosing the most appropriate chart type depending on your data and it relationships.

#### Deviation
Emphasise variations (+/-) from a fixed reference point. Typically the reference point is zero but it can also be a target or a long-term average. Can also be used to show sentiment (positive/neutral/negative).

**Examples:** Showing the number of people entering or exiting a site over a period of time. Showing satisfaction with a component in a training. Demographics pyramid in a site, showing popuation breakdown by age and gender.

![Diverging bar](/part1/images/deviation1.png) 
**Diverging bar:** A simple standard bar chart that can handle both negative and positive magnitude values.

![Diverging stacked bar](/part1/images/deviation2.png) 
**Diverging bar:** Perfect for presenting survey results which involve sentiment (eg disagree/neutral/agree).

![Spine](/part1/images/deviation3.png) 
**Spine:** Splits a single value into two contrasting components (eg male/female).

![Surplus/deficit filled line](/part1/images/deviation4.png) 
**Surplus/deficit filled line:** The shaded area of these charts allows a balance to be shown â€“ either against a
baseline or between two series.

## Corellation
Show the relationship between two or more variables. Be mindful that, unless you tell them otherwise, many readers
will assume the relationships you show them to be causal (i.e. one causes the other).

**Examples:** Showing the relationships between areas of origin and current location of displacement.

**Scatterplot:** The standard way to show the relationship between two continuous variables, each of which has its own axis.
